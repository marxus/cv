## Amit Marcus (@marxus) CV

### **_What I Bring:_**
DevOps & FullStack skills, with lots of AWS experience and a can-do attitude.

My passion is working within a small-medium development team (4-10 members), emphasizing a healthy ego-less environment, problem solving as a team effort, and empowering colleagues via honest feedback, code reviews, guidance and professional initiation.  
I also have experience working solo and taking ownership from end-to-end on a project.

I performed a broad spectrum of roles, as shown in my skill set and past experience.  
I’m a fast learner and adopter of new techs, most of them are self-taught.  
I also have very good analytic understanding and debugging skills.

Worked comfortably with both local and overseas co-workers.
