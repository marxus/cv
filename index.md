## Skills:

### 🐍 Python:
- Backend WebDev - worked with various frameworks such as Flask/Bottle/TurboGears and  Django
- Familier with popular tooling for development such as venv/pipenv/poetry, pytest/unittest/nose, standard libs and other open source packages
- Enjoy "exploiting" python's duck-type nature (if it quacks like a 🦆), but also familier with static type annonation and checkers such as mypy

- can also work with the now EOL 2 branch when and if needed

### 📜 JavaScript/NodeJS:
- Frontend WebDev - using React ⚛️ (love them useHooks), AngularJS ("v1"), also fiddled around with some VueJS. but undoubtedly prefers React for it's immutable one-way data flow design
- Browser ("html5") APIs and interacting with the DOM, using vanilla JS and legacy libs such as jQuery💲
- Good understanding of the async nature of the JavaScript event loop and web/service-workers

### ☁️ Cloud:
- AWS - general usage using IAM roles, S3, Route53, SES, RDS, deploying serverless Lambda's apps with API-gateway and suchs.
- AWS - more advanced VPC usages: EC2, networking, secutiry groups, setting up bastion hosts and vpn access ... and ofcourse - containerized apps on ECS using Fargate and ALB

### 🛰️ Salesforce:
- "Backend" - using SF builtin tools such as process builder, workflows, custom objects, field validations and more... but as a dev in heart, I rather leverage Apex (SF's internal cloud language, a java subset) classes and triggers and apis for simplifing advance requirments using code
- "Frontend" - mainly SF Classic - customize layouts and widgets using VisualForce and custom HTML/JS/CSS
- Data migration using SF standard tools such as DataLoader and writing custom tools to push/pull data using SOQL
- Good knowledge on how SF user/role/permission/sharing model works and SF limits
