## Amit Marcus (@marxus) CV

### OneLiner:
FullStack developer (Python/JS) with a DevOps orientation for a good neat and clean app deployment (containerized/serverless) on the cloud (AWS)

### Looking For:
A place I can enjoy acquiring and improving my current skills in larger scales, mainly Backend/DevOps

## Skills:

### 🐍 Python:
- Backend WebDev - worked with various frameworks such as Flask/Bottle/TurboGears and  Django
- Familiar with popular tooling for development such as venv/pipenv/poetry, pytest/unittest/nose, standard libs and other open source packages
- Using it to write automation and general purpose scripts for *nix envs (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`)
- Really like python's duck-type nature (if it quacks like a 🦆, see: [destructipy](https://github.com/marxus/destructipy)), but also Familiar with static type annotation and checkers such as mypy
- Enjoy "exploiting" python's dynamic import system for monkey-patching 🐒 to solve [problems](https://gist.github.com/marxus/78b18f59456d39963e2f481f5973c81a)
- can also work with the now EOL 2 branch when and if needed

### 📜 JavaScript/NodeJS:
- Frontend WebDev - using React ⚛️ (love them useHooks), AngularJS ("v1"), also fiddled around with some VueJS. but undoubtedly prefers React for it's immutable one-way data flow design
- Browser ("html5") APIs and interacting with the DOM, using vanilla JS and legacy libs such as jQuery💲
- Good understanding of the async nature of the JavaScript event loop and web/service-workers
- Bundle tools, transpilers and preprocessors - NPM/YARN, Webpack, Babel and LESS/SASS/PostCSS, compiled-to-js languages such as TypeScript and CoffeeScript ☕
- Backend WebDev - some experience with express.js
- Early adopter of new ES(next) features and syntax
- Some Android 🤖/iOS dev using Cordova/PhoneGap 📱

### ☁️ Cloud:
- AWS - general usage using IAM roles, S3, Route53, SES, SQS, RDS, CloudWatch
- Deploying serverless Lambda **λ** apps behind API-Gateway/ALB
- AWS - more advanced VPC usages: EC2, networking, security groups, setting up bastion hosts and vpn access ... and of course - containerized apps on ECS using Fargate and ALB
- Infrastructure as Code - provisioning all the above using Terraform 🌎 as a IaC tool
- some experience with GCP (app engine as dev) and Azure (as NT based domain/active directory admin)

### ⚙️ DevOps:
- CI/CD on the cloud - using AWS CodePipeline - code-commit/build/deploy
- Docker 🐳 - writing Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml files
- Manage Linux 🐧 web app servers using NGINX and supervisor
- SQL - using and managing PostgreSQL/MySQL/MariaDB locally and on AWS RDS
- Accustomed to the GNU/Linux toolchain, bash scripting, git, curl, etc...

### 🛰️ Salesforce:
- "Backend" - using SF builtin tools such as process builder, workflows, custom objects, field validations and more... but as a dev in heart, I rather leverage Apex (SF's internal cloud language, a java subset) classes and triggers and apis for simplifying advance requirements using code
- "Frontend" - mainly SF Classic - customize layouts and widgets using VisualForce and custom HTML/JS/CSS
- Data migration using SF standard tools such as DataLoader and writing custom tools to push/pull data using SOQL
- Good knowledge on how SF user/role/permission/sharing model works and SF limits

### 🐆 Misc:
- Used to manage 500+ users physical network, know my way  with switches/routers with vlans for private/public subnets separation, good experience with Fortigate products, NT Domains and Exchange Servers. some PowerShell
- Used to write some C#/ASP.NET back in the day when I developed under MS-Windows (around ~2011). much has changed since but I guess I can manage my way
- Taught newbies some Python/JS/HTML/CSS/SQL

### 💻 Setup:
- Usually working under KDE Neon (Ubuntu 20.04) with PyCharm, WebStorm and VSCode

### ⁉️ About:
- 35 years old. coding on and off since 13 y/o (good ol' Turbo Pascal). on a regular basis for the last 13 years
- Currently lives in Beer-Sheva 🐪, Israel
- In a relationship. expecting +1 soon 👶
- Bachelor of Education from Beit-Berl College

- For sports and fun: rock climbing 🧗‍♂️, running 🏃‍♂️ and road cycling 🚴🏿

### 💼 Past Jobs:
- **2020-Today:** Drorsoft - (latest venture, still under construction) - cooperative - web dev and infrastructure as code dev-ops solutions for AWS

- **2014-2019:** - ItMyWay - Salesforce integration company (acquired skills - salesforce apex, front-end React, google cloud engine)

- **2010-2013:** - 4P-Tech (non existent anymore), small 6 person company for web development - (acquired skills Python, JS, Linux administration on the AWS EC2)

- Most of my work was done solo or in a small development team (2-3 members). so I had to learn the entire relevant tech spectrum and roles. I have a very good understanding in software requirement specification, DB Models, and deployment.

- probably there is more stuff I did, some side projects and fooling around with code.
