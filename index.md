**Amit Marcus (@marxus) CV**

**One Liner:**

FullStack Developer (Python/JavaScript) with a DevOps orientation for a good neat and clean app deployment (containerized/serverless) on the cloud (mostly AWS experience).

I have a lot of experience working solo or in small development teams (2-3 members) where I performed the broad spectrum of roles, and self-taught myself new techs and expertise, as shown in my skill set and past jobs.

**Looking For:**

A place I can enjoy acquiring and improving my current skills in larger scales, with new tech, modern best-practices and a strong dev team, mainly in the Backend/DevOps fields.
