## Amit Marcus (@marxus) CV

### 1️⃣ One Liner:

FullStack Developer (Python/JavaScript/GoLang) with a DevOps orientation for a good neat and clean app deployment (containerized/serverless) on the cloud (lots of AWS experience).

### 🔍 Looking For:

A place I can enjoy acquiring and improving my current skills in larger scales, with new tech, modern best-practices and a strong dev team, mainly in the Backend/DevOps fields.

I have experience working both solo and in small-medium development teams (2-8 members) where I performed the broad spectrum of roles, and self-taught myself new techs and expertise, as shown in my skill set and past experience.

Worked comfortablably with both local and over-seas co-workers.
